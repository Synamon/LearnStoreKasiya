    <string name="quadraticLessonText">This is a quadratic equation. These equations are very
    important in the world of Mathematics. These are one of the first type of equations
    all mathematicians need to learn to solve and work with. Though they may look complicated and
    hard - they are quite easy to solve.</string>

    <string name="quadraticLesson2Text">What makes an equation quadratic? All quadratic equations
    have squared term - this means that they will have something like x<sup><small>2</small></sup>.
    The first expression above is a quadratic equation, so is the second one. But the second one
    is not. Now that you are able to spot quadratic equations you can begin to solve them...</string>

    <string name="quadraticLesson4Text">First we must learn and use factors. For example factors of 12
    are numbers that can divide 36 without any remainders. So the factors of 36 are: 1x12, 2x6, 3x4,
    . 1,2,3,4,6.</string>
